Jenkins Extension for Google Chrome
==================================

This extension monitors Jenkins, a continuous integration server. For more
information about Jenkins take a look at: <http://jenkins-ci.org/>

The options of this extension allows you to set the URL of your Jenkins. By
default it will check the status of the Jenkins instance used for Jenkins
itself at <http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/>

The button of this extension will show a green "OK" if the builds succeeds, if
the build fails the button shows a red "Fail". A click on the button will show 
you the status of your jobs and the time of the last update.

You can get the source for this extension and file bugs or feature requests at
github: <http://github.com/sanitz/jenkins-chrome-extension>

You can install the extension at the [offical
